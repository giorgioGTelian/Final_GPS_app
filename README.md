<h1>DEck.gl</h1>

[Deck.gl](https://deck.gl/docs)


deck.gl is designed to simplify high-performance, WebGL-based visualization of large data sets. 
<br>Users can quickly get impressive visual results with minimal effort by composing existing layers, or leverage deck.gl's extensible architecture to address custom needs.
<br>
deck.gl maps data (usually an array of JSON objects) into a stack of visual layers - e.g. icons, polygons, texts; 
and look at them with views: e.g. map, first-person, orthographic.<br>
<br>
deck.gl handles a number of challenges out of the box:
<br>
Performant rendering and updating of large data sets<br>
Interactive event handling such as picking, highlighting and filtering<br>
Cartographic projections and integration with major basemap providers including Mapbox, Google Maps and ESRI<br>
A catalog of proven, well-tested layers<br>
Deck.gl is designed to be highly customizable. 
<br>All layers come with flexible APIs to allow programmatic control of each aspect of the rendering. <br>
All core classes such are easily extendable by the users to address custom use cases.
